Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently pursuing my diploma in Information and Communication Technology, with hands-on experience in:

🗃️ Database Design

Throughout my academic journey, I've developed and contributed to various user-focused systems using:

Languages & Technologies:

I’m especially interested in creating scalable web applications and exploring the intersection of software development and cybersecurity. I also have a foundational understanding of IT systems, networking, and cybersecurity principles, which I continue to build on through practical projects and learning.

🚀 What Drives Me
I’m driven by curiosity and the thrill of turning ideas into working code. Whether it's designing a clean interface, writing efficient backend logic, or fixing a tricky bug — I enjoy the process of building something that works and helps people.

I see every project as a chance to learn something new, collaborate with others, and push my skills a little further. Technology is always evolving — and so am I.

Thanks for visiting!
